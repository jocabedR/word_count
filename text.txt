Welcome!

In this tutorial, we are going to teach you about Elixir fundamentals - the language syntax, how to define modules, how to manipulate the characteristics of common data structures, and more. This chapter will focus on ensuring that Elixir is installed and that you can successfully run Elixirâ€™s Interactive Shell, called IEx.

Our requirements are (see elixir -v):

    Elixir 1.11.0 onwards
    Erlang/OTP 22 onwards
